# Overview  
### Smart Embedded Control & Sensing Platform  
*A training project developed as part of the “Complete Electronics Hardware Design Course 2025 – EsteemPCB” on Udemy.*

The **Smart Embedded Control & Sensing Platform** is a compact, feature-rich controller board designed to demonstrate professional electronic hardware design practices. The board integrates sensing, motor control, audio functionality, and multi-protocol communications into a single embedded platform.

This design was completed during my training in the **Complete Electronics Hardware Design Course 2025 – EsteemPCB**, where I practiced requirements analysis, schematic design, PCB layout, component selection, and system documentation using industry-standard workflows.
